task5 : Banking works by transferring money from account A to account B. Most of the time
 account A is in one bank while account B is another bank. Implement the code to
 transfer money. Remember, payee's code runs on a different computer than that of
 the receiver's code.
 1. What are the issues in such a system?
 2. What can we do to mitigate some of the issues ?
 3. Write the fixing yourself to demonstrate the mitigations.

 solutions:

1. Issues in a system involving money transfers between different banks:
    a. Security: Security is a significant concern when transferring money between different banks. Unauthorized access, data breaches, 
    or interception of sensitive information during transmission can lead to financial loss and compromised customer accounts.

    b. Transaction Consistency: Ensuring transaction consistency across different banks can be challenging. There is a risk of 
    incomplete or inconsistent transfers if both banks involved do not agree on the successful completion of the transaction.

    c. Interoperability: Different banks may have varying systems, protocols, and APIs, making it challenging to establish 
    seamless integration for money transfers.

    d. Timeliness: Transfer delays due to network issues, system downtime, or validation processes can impact the promptness 
    of transactions.

2. Mitigations for the issues mentioned above:
    a. Security: Implementing robust encryption algorithms, secure network protocols (such as SSL/TLS), 
    and multi-factor authentication can help ensure the security and integrity of data during transit. Banks should also 
    implement rigorous access control measures, regular security audits, and comprehensive fraud detection mechanisms.

    b. Transaction Consistency: Adopting standardized protocols, such as the ISO 20022 messaging standard, can facilitate 
    consistent communication and transaction synchronization between banks. Implementing two-phase commit or similar distributed transaction management protocols can ensure that both banks agree on the successful completion of the transaction.

    c. Interoperability: Banks can establish standardized APIs, data formats, and communication protocols to enable seamless
    interoperability between different banking systems. Industry-wide initiatives, such as open banking, aim to promote 
    standardized interfaces and enhance collaboration between banks.

    d. Timeliness: Implementing robust infrastructure and network redundancy measures can minimize network-related delays. 
    Banks should also optimize their internal processes and systems to expedite transaction processing, validation, and settlement.

3. A comprehensive solution to demonstrate mitigations would involve designing and implementing a distributed transaction system using secure 
communication protocols, standardized messaging formats, and transaction coordination mechanisms. This system would ensure 
secure and consistent money transfers between different banks. However, such an implementation would require a sophisticated 
infrastructure and integration capabilities beyond the scope of a code snippet.
