Mandatory : Elaborate what your internship or academic projects were?
 a. What did the system do?
    At Openhouse, I am working as a Product Engineer. One of the projects I worked on was the Member App and Alfred. 
    For the Member App, I integrated Clevertap and Smarlook analytics using React, React Native, and TypeScript. 
    This allowed us to track user behavior and gain insights into app usage. 
    As for Alfred, I optimized the v4 attendance APIs by improving their performance and added filters to 
    enhance the functionality of the attendance management system. 
    Additionally, I built a Relational Manager (RM) Dashboard using React, which provided RM-specific data and analytics

    At tata 1mg, I worked as sde-1 backend Engineer. I was in the monitization team and responsible for integrating video ads in the search bar page and also migrated
    zeus apis to merch service. This actually helped to understand the overall api flows. Along with that i have also written unit test cases 
    for some apis there.

 b. What other systems have you seen in the wild like that?
    In the industry, I have come across various systems similar to 
    the ones I worked on during my internship. Member apps are quite common among organizations, 
    allowing members or users to access specific features or services. Attendance management systems are also widely used
    in different domains, including education and workforce management. 
    Similarly, dashboards for specific user roles or analytics purposes are quite prevalent in various industries.
    
    Also my internship at SRM university, i was invovled in making full e-commerce website. That's for the first time i reliazed the 
    how industry actually works and i did the payment integrations, also build the add to cart functionality. It was a great learning 
    experience.


 c. Howdoyou approach the development problem?
    When approaching development problems, I follow a 
    systematic approach. Firstly, I analyze the requirements and specifications provided by stakeholders or clients. 
    Then, I break down the project into smaller tasks or modules and prioritize them based on importance and dependencies. 
    I conduct research on the relevant technologies, frameworks, and best practices to determine the most suitable solution. 
    I then proceed with coding, testing, and iterating based on feedback. Throughout the development process, I maintain clear 
    communication with the team to ensure alignment and address any challenges that may arise.


 d. What were interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow?
     While developing projects, I have occasionally referred to code snippets or solutions on 
     Stack Overflow to solve specific problems or overcome roadblocks. Stack Overflow is a valuable 
     resource that provides a vast repository of knowledge shared by developers worldwide. I typically use it when encountering 
     issues related to specific libraries, frameworks, or edge cases that require a workaround. It's important to note that I always 
     make sure to understand and modify the code to fit my specific use case, ensuring that it aligns with best practices and 
     meets the project's requirements.


 e. What did you learn from some very specific copy paste? Mention explicitly
 some of them.
    Copy-pasting specific code snippets from Stack Overflow has taught me several valuable lessons. Some of them include:
        Understanding different approaches: When encountering an issue, I often come across multiple solutions on Stack Overflow. 
        Copying and studying different code snippets helped me gain insights into alternative approaches, compare their pros and cons, 
        and choose the most suitable one for my project.

        Debugging techniques: By examining code snippets from Stack Overflow, I learned various debugging techniques and strategies 
        that helped me identify and resolve issues more effectively. Understanding how other developers debugged similar problems 
        improved my problem-solving skills.

        Learning best practices: Stack Overflow provides code snippets from experienced developers, allowing me to learn and 
        incorporate industry best practices into my own code. This exposure to different coding styles and practices has been 
        beneficial in improving the quality and readability of my code.

    Overall, Stack Overflow has been a valuable resource that has enhanced my learning and problem-solving capabilities as a developer.
