Task File -> Blox Interns_freshers SD Questions.pdf

Question 1 is mandatory -> solution for the question 1 is in task1.txt file

Out of other questions you have to answer 2, so choose wisely -> I have chosen fourth and fifth questioin from the task file, that is actually divided into 2 parts
                                                                 the first one is the file with extension .txt indicating the theortical solution and other is actually fitle with extension .py
                                                                 demostrating the solution in python code
